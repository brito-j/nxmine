# B U R N O U T
> <b>Burnout</b> is a variant of tic-tac-toe with an added element of chance.

The goal of <b>Burnout</b> is to successfully place three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row in spite of randomly generated mines that clear previously placed marks.

Marks cleared by mines can be placed again by clicking on the mine. A mine that is clicked but not replaced by a mark is a new mine randomly generated on that turn and at that location.

Once the game is won, the statistics for the game can be saved and viewed later on the <i>Statistics</i> page.

Good luck!
